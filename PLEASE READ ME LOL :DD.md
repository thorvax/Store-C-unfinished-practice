This is a program that I created on aug 12 to enhance and gain knowledge about the use of programmng language called c++..
This program has the ability to store values, change values, display values of the products' prices.
It was created with fun in mind so I hope that this program might inspire you to create one yourself.

I don't mind you copying it all as this was just a "fun little project" of mine.


Personal note: 
I created this with fun in mind and I started leaning c++ mainly becuase
I wanted to create "fun proframs" that I can use to "brag" to my friends and prank them lol...
well the thing that pushes me 
to learn c++ was really because it was said that it was the one of the fastest still active language out there.
They said that once you learn c++ you'll be likely at ease in trying to learn a new language as
C was their predecessor language IDK LOL..

I should have learned python TBH and HTML to better create an easy program to prank my friends...
